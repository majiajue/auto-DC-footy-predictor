Football results predictor based on Dixon-Coles method
http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf

Data from http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

Based on previous results, a home advantage parameter for all teams, and attack and defense parameters
 for each team are calculated. These parameters influence a distribution of potential goals scored for each team (Poisson) over
which probabilities can be summed to figure out the probability of a home win,
draw or home loss. The previous results are also weighted exponentially by their age (old results 
are less relevant to present form).

The teams are:

Arsenal    | Aston Villa | Burnley   | Chelsea     | Crystal Palace
:---------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:--------------:
**Everton**    | **Hull**        | **Leicester** | **Liverpool**   | **Man City**
**Man United** | **Newcastle**   | **QPR**       | **Southampton** | **Stoke**
**Sunderland** | **Swansea**     | **Tottenham** | **West Brom**   | **West Ham**
